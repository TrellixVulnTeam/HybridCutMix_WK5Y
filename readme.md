# Hybrid Attentive CutMix

This repository is the official implementation of [Hybrid Attentive CutMix]. 

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Data Preperation
To download datasets:

    CUB-200-2011: 

    Stanford Cars:

    IP102:

    MosquitoDL

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python3 ../train.py --gpus '0' --data_type "cub200" --pretrained --batch_size 16 --crop_size 448 \
    --train_mode "hybrid" --learning_rate 1e-2 --weight_decay 5e-4 \
    --radius 4 --multiplier 4 --cut_prob 0.1 \ 
    --expr_name "R50_Hybrid_P01"
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
